## Hi there, my name is Mozart Rafi Kurniawan Tampubolon 👋

I specialize in project management and maintenance within the development environment. While I may not be a developer myself, I possess a solid understanding of overseeing and enhancing existing projects. I am deeply committed to contributing improvements wherever possible. Additionally, I lead an online community organization known as [@stegripe](https://stegripe.org/github).

## Have a look to my random widgets ⬇️
